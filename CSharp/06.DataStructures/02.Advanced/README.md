### <h2> ðŸ“‘Course Description </h2>
The Advanced Data Structures course introduces participants to the implementation of balanced trees (2 -3 trees), AVL trees, red-black and AA trees. You will learn to work with hash tables, tuples and associative arrays, as well as implement hashing algorithms and how to handle collisions. Working with data structures helps to better organize information, as well as to improve the quality of program execution. They are also of great importance in the construction of a number of algorithms. As an additional knowledge, students will also learn how to build on various data structures to optimize the solving of specific problems.
